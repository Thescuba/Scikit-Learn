# Scikit-Learn
Just some examples of Scikit-Learn code and fun way to play with data. 
Everything I have here is open to uses so please free free to mess around,
I only ask that you leave me as a reference, 


So before installing scikit-learn you need 
Python (>= 2.6 or >= 3.3),
NumPy (>= 1.6.1),
SciPy (>= 0.9).

These can be easily installed using pip along with scikit-learn
